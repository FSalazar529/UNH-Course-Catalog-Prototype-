# UNH Course Catalog Assistant (RAG-Powered)

An intelligent chatbot prototype using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology that helps students find information about University of New Hampshire's Accounting and Finance (ACFI) graduate courses. The system dynamically processes course data from the [UNH Catalog](https://catalog.unh.edu/graduate/course-descriptions/acfi/) to provide accurate, up-to-date responses.

## Features

### ðŸ¤– RAG-Powered Intelligence
- **Semantic Search**: Advanced natural language understanding using embedding-based similarity
- **Dynamic Data Processing**: Real-time course information from UNH catalog
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Intelligent retrieval and generation based on query intent
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context throughout the conversation

### ðŸ“š Course Information
- **Comprehensive Details**: Course descriptions, prerequisites, credits, and learning objectives
- **Smart Search**: Search by course code, course name, or topic keywords
- **Course Comparison**: Compare multiple courses side-by-side
- **Category Filtering**: Find courses by discipline (finance vs accounting)

### ðŸŽ¨ User Experience
- **Interactive UI**: Modern, responsive design with UNH branding
- **Real-time Updates**: System status indicators and data freshness information
- **Quick Actions**: Pre-built buttons for common queries
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback to cached data when needed

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser
2. Type your question in the chat input or click one of the quick question buttons
3. The chatbot will respond with relevant course information
